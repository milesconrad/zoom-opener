# zoom-opener
Automatic zoom opener for virtual learning, written in Java. Your week 1 schedule is stored in AutoOpener1.java, your week 2 schedule is stored in AutoOpener2.java, your links are stored in Opener.java, and the main class is GUI.java.

For half days and weird schedules, there are additional buttons that link directly to your individual classes.
