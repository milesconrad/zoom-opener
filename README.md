# zoom-opener
Automatic zoom opener for virtual learning, now written in Python using tkinter. Your week 1 schedule is stored in the first element of the schedule list, and your week 2 schedule is stored in the second element of the schedule list. Your class links are stored at the beginning of the file.

For half days and weird schedules, there are additional buttons that link directly to your individual classes.
